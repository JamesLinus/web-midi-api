      <p>
        Some user agents have connected music devices, such as synthesizers, 
        keyboard and other controllers, and drum machines.  The widely adopted 
        Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol enables 
        electronic musical instruments, controllers and computers to 
        communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit 
        audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical notes, 
        controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, 
        cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific MIDI 
        communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch 
        data).  This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses, 
        such as show control, lighting and special effects control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems.  At the same time, the Web MIDI API is not intended to become a semantic controller platform; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically.
      </p>
      <p>
        To some users, "MIDI" has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files and General MIDI.  That is not the intent of this API; the use case of simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this specification (it could be considered a different format to be supported by the HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, for example).  The Web MIDI API is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI - external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example, or even the software synthesizers that are built in to many common operating systems.  The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs - using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind instrument controllers) to control web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API and High-Resolution Time.  This API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API specification defines a means for web developers to
        enumerate, manipulate and access MIDI devices - for example interfaces that may provide hardware MIDI ports with other devices plugged in to them and USB devices that support the USB-MIDI specification. Having a Web API for MIDI enables web applications that use existing software and
        hardware synthesizers, hardware music controllers and light systems and other mechanical
        apparatus controlled by MIDI.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API has been defined with a wide variety of use cases in mind.  The approaches taken by this API are similar to those taken in Apple's CoreMIDI API and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API; that is, the API is designed to represent the low-level software protocol of MIDI, in order to enable developers to build powerful MIDI software on top.  The API enables the developer to enumerate input and output interfaces, and send and receive MIDI messages, but (similar to the aforementioned APIs) it does not attempt to semantically define or interpret MIDI messages beyond what is necessary to robustly support current devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API is not intended to directly implement high-level concepts such as sequencing; it does not directly support Standard MIDI Files, for example, although a Standard MIDI File player can be built on top of the Web MIDI API.  It is also not intended to semantically capture patches or controller assignments, as General MIDI does; such interpretation is outside the scope of the Web MIDI API (though again, General MIDI can easily be utilized through the Web MIDI API).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>API Overview</h3>
        <p>The Web MIDI API consists of the following set of interfaces and objects, as well as some supporting interfaces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <a href="#requestMIDIAccess">requestMIDIAccess</a> method, which is supported on the window.navigator object in user agents.  This method enables a developer to request access to MIDI on the system.
          </li>
          <li>A <a href="#MIDIAccess">MIDIAccess</a> object, which enables enumeration of and access to the MIDI devices available to the user agent.
          </li>
          <li>A <a href="#MIDIPort">MIDIPort</a> interface, which represents a MIDI input or output port and exposes information about the interface - its name, manufacturer, type and unique identifier.
          </li>
          <li>A <a href="#MIDIInput">MIDIInput</a> interface deriving from MIDIPort that enables MIDI message handlers to be attached to the device.
          </li>
          <li>A <a href="#MIDIOutput">MIDIOutput</a> interface deriving from MIDIPort that additionally exposes methods to send MIDI messages to the output port.
          </li>
          <li>A <a href="#MIDIEvent">MIDIEvent</a> interface, which represents the Event object passed to a MIDIInput's onmessage handler and contains a sequence of MIDI data bytes along with a timestamp.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        There are two primary security and privacy concerns with adding the Web MIDI API to the web platform:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Allowing the enumeration of the user's MIDI interfaces is a potential target for fingerprinting (that is, uniquely identifying a user by the specific MIDI interfaces they have connected).  Note that in this context, what can be enumerated is the MIDI <i>interfaces</i> - not, for example, an individual sampler or synthesizer plugged into a MIDI interface, as these would not be enumerated, unless those devices are connected to the host computer with USB (USB-MIDI devices typically have their own MIDI interface, and would be enumerated).  The interfaces that could be fingerprinted are equivalent to MIDI "ports".  This potential needs to be further investigated; the vast majority of systems have relatively few MIDI interfaces attached, so it is possible this is of little concern in practice.</li>
        <li>Additionally, combined access to input and output ports on a given device (the ability to send <b>and</b> receive system exclusive messages, in particular) might allow sophisticated developers to query and test for particular MIDI-connected devices, such as samplers, and either using the presence of those devices for more precise fingerprinting, destroying data (erasing samples or patches on the devices), attempting to capture data from the devices (e.g. downloading samples from samplers, then uploading to the network), or simply initiating malicious action (e.g. sending MIDI commands to a lighting control system to turn lights on and off). </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These issues will be further explored prior to this specification becoming a Recommendation.  In the meantime, the <a href="#requestMIDIAccess">suggested security model</a> explicitly allows user agents to require the user's approval before giving access to MIDI devices, although it is not currently required to prompt the user for this approval.  It is noted that some web systems (e.g. Java) give access to MIDI interfaces without prompting, although this may not be the security model that this specification eventually uses.

      <h2>Obtaining Access to MIDI Interfaces Available to the User Agent</h2>

      <section>
          <h2 id="requestMIDIAccess">requestMIDIAccess()</h2>

          <dl class="idl"
              title="partial interface Navigator">

                This call SHOULD prompt the user for access to MIDI devices. If 
                the user gives express permission or the call is otherwise approved, 
                <var>successCallback</var> is invoked, with a 
                <code><a>MIDIAccess</a></code> object as its argument.  The 
                underlying system may choose to allow the user to select specific
                MIDI interfaces to expose to this API (i.e. pick and choose interfaces
                on an individual basis), although this is not required.
                If the user declines or the call is denied, the 
                <var>errorCallback</var> (if any) is invoked.

            A unique ID of the port. This can be used by developers to 
            remember ports the user has chosen for their application. The 
            User Agent MUST ensure that the <code><a>id</a></code> 
            is unique to only that port.  The User Agent SHOULD ensure that 
            the id is maintained across instances of the 
            application - e.g., when the system is rebooted - and when a 
            device is removed from the system.  Applications may want to 
            cache these ids locally to re-create a MIDI setup. 
            Some systems may not support completely unique persistent 
            identifiers; in such cases, it will be more challenging to 
            maintain identifiers when another interface is added or removed 
            from the system.  (This might throw off the index of the 
            requested port.)  It is expected that the system will do the 
            best it can to match a port across instances of the MIDI API: 
            for example, storing the port interface manufacturer, name and 
            index in the id, and attempting to find any ports with 
            that name to consider as a match. Applications may use the 
            comparison of id of MIDIPorts to test for equality.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Listing Inputs and Outputs</h3>
        <p>This example gets the list of the input and output ports and prints their information to the console log.
          <pre class="code es-code">function listInputsAndOutputs( midiAccess ) {
  var inputs = midiAccess.getInputs();
